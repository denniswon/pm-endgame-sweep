# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack in rsa crate (timing sidechannel)
# This comes from sqlx-mysql which is pulled in by sqlx-macros-core unconditionally,
# even though we only use PostgreSQL (default-features = false, features = ["postgres"]).
# The vulnerable code path is not exercised in our application.
# No upstream fix is available - https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
# Remove this ignore when sqlx updates or rsa releases a patched version.
